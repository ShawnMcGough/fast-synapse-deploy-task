# Fast Synapse Deploy


## Overview
This action will deploy Azure Synapse artifacts, fast! 
It is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the aging *Microsoft Synapse deployment task*, 
with a focus on speed, reliability, and modern features.

### Major Features
 - **Zero Deployment (v3+):** Skips the entire deployment when nothing has changed (via template hash check).
 - **Selective Deployment (v3+):** Deploys only new or modified artifacts—skips unchanged artifacts entirely.
 - **Adaptive Speed Throttling (v2+):** Automatically adjusts request rates, with options for `safe`, `fast`, or `yolo` speeds.
 - **Latest Auth Support:** Azure authentication managed outside of the task to always be up to date including **Federated Credentials (OIDC)**.
 - **Proxy Support**:  HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, and NO_PROXY environment variables.
 - **Large Template Support**: Can be combined with `validate` from [Microsoft task](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AzureSynapseWorkspace.synapsecicd-deploy) to overcome [20 MB size issue](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/cicd/continuous-integration-delivery#1-publish-failed-workspace-arm-file-is-more-than-20-mb).

## Comparison to *Microsoft Synapse deployment task*

Fast Synapse Deploy has significant speed improvements over the Microsoft Synapse deployment task, no matter the size of the workspace.

> \* To be clear, Zero Deployment detects no changes and skips the deployment entirely.

## Zero Deployment / Hash Check (v3+)
> ⚠️ **Requires task version 3 or later.**

Zero deployment **skips the entire deployment** when nothing has changed. A SHA256 hash of your resolved template is stored in workspace tags and compared on subsequent runs.

### Example Output (No Changes)

```
===========================================================================================
DEPLOYMENT HASH CHECK
===========================================================================================
  Current template hash:  A1B2C3D4E5F6789...
  Stored deployment hash: A1B2C3D4E5F6789...

  [OK] HASHES MATCH - Workspace is already up to date!
===========================================================================================

  ZERO DEPLOYMENT - No changes detected
  Completed in 1.3 seconds
```

### When Deployment Runs

| Scenario | Deploys? |
|----------|----------|
| First deployment | ✅ Yes |
| Template changed | ✅ Yes |
| Parameters changed | ✅ Yes |
| Nothing changed | ❌ Skipped |

---

## Selective Deployment (v3+)

> ⚠️ **Requires task version 3 or later.**

Selective deployment compares your template against the workspace and **deploys only what changed**. Unchanged artifacts are skipped.

Dry run outputs the same analysis but exits without making any changes.

### Example Output

```
=== Selective Deployment Analysis ===
Analysis completed in 45.2 seconds

  NEW artifacts:        12  (will deploy)
  CASCADED artifacts:   28  (will deploy, parent is NEW)
  MODIFIED artifacts:    3  (will deploy)
  UNCHANGED artifacts: 2448  (will SKIP)

Deploying 43 artifacts instead of 2491
Reduction: 98%
```

---

## Throttle Configuration (v2+)

> ⚠️ **Requires task version 2 or later.**

### TL;DR: Leave the Defaults...

**For most users, no configuration is needed.** FastSynapseDeploy automatically:
- Adjusts request rates based on your deployment size
- Backs off and retries when rate limits are hit
- Recovers gracefully from 429 errors

Just run the task and let it handle throttling for you.

### ... Unless you have the Need for Speed

**Many deployments can be deployed significantly faster** by setting `SYNAPSE_DEPLOYMENT_SPEED=yolo`. However, there is a greater chance of hitting rate limits (429 errors). These limits are not documented and appear to vary based on time of day and region.

### When to Change Settings

| Scenario | Recommended Action |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Deployments work fine** | Do nothing. Keep defaults. |
| **Frequent 429 errors / failures** | Set `SYNAPSE_DEPLOYMENT_SPEED=safe` |
| **Want maximum speed** | Set `SYNAPSE_DEPLOYMENT_SPEED=yolo` |
| **Need fine-grained control** | Set specific env variables (advanced) |

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SYNAPSE_DEPLOYMENT_SPEED` | `auto` | Controls throttling strategy: `auto`, `fast`, `safe`, or `yolo` |
| `SYNAPSE_MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` | `25` | Maximum parallel API requests (overrides speed-based calculation) |
| `SYNAPSE_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE` | `0` (auto) | Hard RPM cap. `0` = automatic based on artifact count |
| `SYNAPSE_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` | `150` | Wait time (seconds) after a 429 error. Range: 30-900 |

### Deployment Speeds

| Speed | Behavior | When to Use |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `auto` | Balanced concurrency and RPM based on artifact count | **Default. Use this unless you have a reason not to.** |
| `safe` | Lower concurrency (15), conservative RPM limits | Experiencing frequent 429s or deployment failures |
| `fast` | Higher concurrency (37), 1.5× RPM limits | Comfortable with occasional 429s for faster deploys |
| `yolo` | Maximum concurrency (100), no RPM limit | Testing, off-peak deployments, or intentionally pushing limits |


If a 429 error occurs, the following happens automatically:
1. Pauses all requests for the cooldown period
2. Reduces concurrency by 25%
3. Tightens RPM limits
4. Retries the failed request

This means **even if you start too aggressive, the tool will adapt**.

> **Tip:** A TooManyRequests (429) event means your deployment had to pause and resume — adding time to your overall deployment. **Ideal deployments have zero 429 events.** If you consistently see rate limit events, consider using `SYNAPSE_DEPLOYMENT_SPEED=safe` or lowering `SYNAPSE_MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` to avoid the delays caused by cooldown periods.

## Combine with the Microsoft 'Validate' Action
This action can work in tandem with the Microsoft `validate` action, which is required to address a [known issue](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/cicd/continuous-integration-delivery#1-publish-failed-workspace-arm-file-is-more-than-20-mb) with file size limit during publish. High level, you would first use `validate` to generate the required templates, then use this action to quickly deploy from those templates. 

## Pre-requisites
Requires [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/overview) installed on the agents.

## Not Supported 
 - Deploying ManagedPrivateEndpoints.
 - Deploying *directly* from branch other than `publish`. 
   - However, can be combined with `validate` task (see note below) to achieve same result.

## Review Me
Please consider [leaving a review](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shawn-mcgough.fast-synapse-deploy&ssr=false#review-details). I love to hear how it is helping with deployments!
At the end of the log there is duration information:

## Telemetry

This action collects **anonymous, minimal usage telemetry** via Azure Application Insights to help the maintainer understand adoption and prioritize improvements. **No sensitive or identifying information is ever collected.**

### What is collected

| Field | Example | Purpose |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Runner OS | `Linux` / `Windows` | Know which platforms to prioritize |
| Action version | `v3` | Track version adoption |
| SHA-256 hash of `github.repository` | `a1b2c3d4e5...` | Count unique repos (cannot be reversed to identify you) |
| Event type | `deploy` / `dry-run` | Understand feature usage |
| Deploy speed | `auto` / `fast` / `safe` / `yolo` | Understand throttle preferences |
| Feature flags | `selective: true` | Understand feature usage |

### What is **never** collected

- Repository name, organization, or usernames
- Azure subscription, resource group, or workspace names
- Template contents, parameters, or file paths
- Tokens, credentials, or IP addresses

### Opting out

Set the `disable-telemetry` input to `true`

### How it works

The telemetry configuration (App Insights connection string and enabled flag) is stored in [.telemetry.json](.telemetry.json) on the `main` branch. At runtime, the telemetry step fetches this config file so that the connection string can be rotated or telemetry can be disabled globally without publishing a new action version. If the config file is unreachable or `enabled` is `false`, telemetry is silently skipped.


## Release Notes
